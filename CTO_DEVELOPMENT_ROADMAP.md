## üìã **IMMEDIATE DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW**

### **Daily Development Cycle:**
1. **Start Development**
   ```bash
   git checkout dev                   # Switch to DEV branch
   npm run dev:dev                   # Local development server
   ```

2. **Feature Development**
   - Code in DEV environment (safe experimentation)
   - Test features thoroughly in isolation
   - Use mocked AWS services for speed

3. **Quality Assurance**
   ```bash
   git push dev                      # Deploy to DEV cloud
   # Test in DEV environment (mimics production)
   ```

4. **Staging Promotion**
   ```bash
   git checkout staging
   git merge dev                     # Move tested features
   git push staging                  # Deploy to STAGING
   # QA testing in production-like environment
   ```

5. **Production Release**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge staging                 # Promote approved features
   git push main                     # Deploy to production
   ```
